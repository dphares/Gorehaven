# Gorehaven
Terminal based text-rpg

In this version, you can go through an intro sequence, register your name, and test the Arena once you arrive at the main hub.
Actual battle in the arena is yet to come, but for now you can enter the arena and request battle multiple times to see the random
enemy generator and random name generator at work.
Next features will be a functioning equipment module, and a functioning battle module.
Extract all files to one folder, and run gorehaven.py to begin.
